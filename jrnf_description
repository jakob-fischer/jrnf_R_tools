    Description of the Reaction Network File Format (JRNF)
    ======================================================
    (date: 1st September 2014   author: Jakob Fischer   mail:jakob@automorph.info) 

The jrnf-file format describes a reaction network consisting out of a set of chemical
species, reaction between those species and (thermo)dynamic parameters. The format 
uses plain linux text file format. Individual entries are integer numbers, floating
point numbers or character strings. They are separated by whitespaces. 


The first line of a file should contain the string "jrnf0003" to identify the file
format and version:
  1: "jrnf0003"


The second line contains two integers. The first is the number of chemical species N, 
the second is the number of reactions in the reaction network M.
  2: <N> <M>


The following N lines each have 4 (whitespace separated) values. Each line represents 
one chemical species and has the following form:
  3 - 2+<N>: <type> <name> <energy> <constant>


The entries each consists of one number or string:
  <type> - Unsigned integer giving the type of the species. Standard is 0, but users
           may use / define additional types. A not recognized type should just be
           ignored by programms (treated as type 0).
  <name> - String that gives the name of the species. May contain alphanumeric 
           characters and underscore. Name should be unique in the network.
  <energy> - Double value containing the formation enthalpy of the species.
  <constant> - Unsigned integer. Value is 1 if the species is constant and 0 else.
               

After the species M lines describe the M reactions. Each line has at least 7 entries. 
2+<N> - 2+<N><M>: <reversible> <c> <k_f> <k_b> <E_a> <educt_number> <product_number> 
                  (<educt_id> <educt_mul>)* (<product_id> <product_mul>)*

The entries in the first bracket shoulc occur exactly <educt_number> times, the entries
in the second brackets <product_number> times. Each individual entrie is either a 
floating point or an unsigned integer number:
  <reversible> - Unsigned integer. The value is '1' if reaction is simulated 
                 reversible. Else the value has to be '0'.
  <c> - Floating point (positive). Reaction constant for stochastic simulations. 
        Not used at the moment.
  <k_f> - Double (positive). Forward reaction rate.
  <k_b> - Double (positive). Backward reaction rate.
  <E_a> - Double (positive). Activation energy. 
  <educt_number> - Unsigned integer. Number of educts in the reaction equation
  <product_number> - Unsigned integer. Number of products in the reaction equation.
  <educt_id> - Unsigned integer. Id of the species occuring on educt side of this
               reaction equation. Species are 1-indexed. 
  <educt_mul> - Unsigned integer. Number of occurences of respective species on the
                educt side of this reaction equation.
  <product_id> - Unsigned integer. Id of the species occuring on product side of this
                 reaction equation. Species are 1-indexed. 
  <product_mul> - Unsigned integer. Number of occurences of respective species on the
                  product side of this reaction equation.
