-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains different functionality to analyze reaction networks. It uses
its own reaction network format. It also includes functionality to randomly 
generate reaction network and initialize a huge amount of simulations to explore
the parameter space.

The code was tested with the current version of R (3.1.1) and current versions for 
the following packages / libraries: pracma, igraph, ggplot2, gridExtra


Please note: The functionality to calculate elementary modes (function
             calculate_elementary_modes in file interface_topana.R) needs
             metatool (fasttool) to be set up in subdirectory metatool.


Content of different files (updated 26th November 2016):
  TEXT:
  =====
 - jrnf_description:
   Description of the network file format used (files ending with jrnf).


  CODE: (header of R-files might be more detailed + up to date)
  =====
   GENERAL TOOLS:
   -------------
 - tools.R:
   Some usefull functions extending the standard library.

 - cycles.R:
   Methods for counting the number of cycles in igraph graphs.

   NETWORK SPECIFIC:
   ----------------
 - jrnf_network.R:
   The most generic functions for handling reaction networks (except file operations)

 - jrnf_network_io.R:
   Functions for in and output of reaction networks (to files, latex tables, plot)

   ANALYSIS:
   --------
 - composition_analysis.R:
   Some early prototypes for code that analyses influence of elementary components
   of chemical species on reaction network properties.

 - interface_topana.R:
   Tools for calculating elementary modes using (external) "metatool".

 - pathway_analysis.R:
   Calculation of reaction pathways. Exactly and also calculation limited to
   "significant" pathways.

 - pathway_analysis_tools.R:
   Helper function for pathway analysis that are generally useful.

 - pathway_analysis_eval.R:
   Methods for calculating derived quantities after having calculated reaction
   pathways. Also calculates derivative properties of

 - potential_analysis.R: 
   For calculating effective chemical potentials of chemical column models and 
   for analysing interaction of chemical potentials with reaction pathways.

   SIMULATIONS:
   -----------
 - art_ecosystem_gen.R:
   Generates artificial ecosystems, that are reaction networks with an elementary 
   composition of species that are driven thermodynamically by photochemical 
   reactions.

 - netodeint_control.R:
   Module generates a big range of simulation for a given network (flow system).
   In contrast to "simulation_builder_flow.R" this module works with biggger 
   networks and selects a range of boundary species depending on topology.

 - simulation_builder.R
   Script for generating files and directory structure of artificial chemistry
   simulations with thermodynamic constraints.

 - simulation_builder_ecol.R:
   Scripts for generating ecosystems that are driven by photoreactions.

 - simulation_builder_evol.R:
   Script for evolving artificial ecologies that consist of an anorganic and an 
   organic part. 

 - simulation_builder_flow.R:
   Automatically generate a big range of flow systems.

 - simulation_builder_plot.R:
   Plot functionality for resalts from "simulation_builder..." methods.


  DATA:
  =====
 - elementary_composition_db.csv:
   For analysis of elementary composition this list (comma separated file) contains
   the elementary composition of some common elements in the form: "species","element","c"

 - species_latex_names.csv: 
   For species whose name can not be transformed into a latex (formula) equivalent
   representation automatically this file contains specific overrides.

 - nasa_polynomials_200_1000.csv:
   Contains coefficients from the following publication (for calculation of 
   thermodynamic quantities of gas phase chemistry species):
   -> McBride et al. Coefficients for calculating thermodynamic and transport 
      properties of individual species, NASA Technical Memorandum 4513, 1993.
