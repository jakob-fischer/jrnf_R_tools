The code was tested with the current version of R (3.1.1) and current versions for the following packages / libraries:
pracma, igraph, ggplot2, gridExtra


Please note: The functionality to calculate elementary modes (function
             calculate_elementary_modes in file interface_topana.R) needs
             metatool (fasttool) to be set up in subdirectory metatool.
